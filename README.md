# Terraform

Welcome to terraform!
Getting started with a new project: first of all, create a new folder in your desktop naming it whatever you want.

Well done, now open Visual Studio Code and open the folder you created.
N.B. You need "Terraform" extention before proceed.

Create a "New file" and rename it "main.tf" > .tf will authomatically refer to terraform.
And now, let's create our first project, an azure resource group in your tenant.
Let's start to write down some scripts in main.tf
